_Managing Vaccination certificates with  High Performance Blockchain (HPB) chain protocols_

Education institutes are on their way to re-opening for students. In face as I write this, many schools in my city at Pune (MH) has opened the schools this week.
Important element to look at is alignment to government regulations on students’ vaccine certificates for them to regularize the classes.
Inspiring from  High Performance Blockchain (HPB) NFT example of Vaccination program - here we make a fresh attempt to depict the stakeholders, scenarios through simple but effective approach to communicate the ecosystem view.

## What it does

We've created creative artwork that conveys an important message about the web's future.

1.	NFT Store where students will be uploading their vaccine certificates – that will go through validation phase before getting it minted. These certificates will be stored on IPFS to have shared access for assigned admins. Vaccine certificate will be minted as NFT on  HPB blockchain. No doubt – each NFT will have associated with expiry date resonating with vaccine certificate.

2.	In addition – below drawings depict how educational institutes could follow the defined protocols – safety, social distancing and sanitization surrounded by infra components – IoT, Cameras & more smart devices to measure the protocol adherence. Students will receive the reward in form of NFT tokens.  

## How we built it

We've made a rough sketch of a painting visualizing how Education could be transitioned to adopt Blockchain, NFT as core elements. As we gear ourselves to Virtual world, bringing quick highlights for the education.

## Challenges we ran into

Where we limit our thoughts in depicting through multiple views.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. Learning  High Performance Blockchain (HPB) in conjunctions with IPFS.
2. Simplifying to digest for maximum audience.

## What we learned

Beyond comfort zones, exploring something new in a very unique and innovative paths.

## What's next for NFTistic

What best than being part of execution team and make this a reality.
